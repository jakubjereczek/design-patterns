Design patterns are an essential part of high-level programming. My goal is to learn their practical application. In this repository, I will present the process of learning patterns and their practical implementations in TypeScript.

Patterns groups:
* Creational patterns introduce more flexible mechanisms for object creation and allow for the reuse of existing code.
* Structural patterns explain how to compose objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and structural efficiency.
* Behavioral patterns deal with efficient communication and division of responsibilities among objects.
